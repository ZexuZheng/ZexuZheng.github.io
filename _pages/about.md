Hi, Welcome to my webpage. I am currently a PhD Candidate from [School of Finance](https://jinrong.swufe.edu.cn/), [SWUFE](https://www.swufe.edu.cn/). My research interest mainly focus on empirical asset pricing, information theory and explainable machine learning.

You can find my CV here: [Zexu Zheng's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/CV.pdf).
