I am currently a Ph.D. Candidate in the [School of Finance](https://jinrong.swufe.edu.cn/) at the Southwestern University of Finance and Economics ([SWUFE](https://www.swufe.edu.cn/)). My research focuses on empirical asset pricing, information theory, and explainable machine learning, with a passion for uncovering insights that bridge finance, data science, and interpretability in AI.

Beyond academia, I enjoy birding, photography, and classical music. These hobbies inspire creativity and precision—qualities I strive to bring to my research and collaborations.

For further details about my academic journey and publications, feel free to explore my [Curriculum Vitae](../assets/CV.pdf). I’m always open to discussing research ideas or sharing birding hotspots—don’t hesitate to reach out!
